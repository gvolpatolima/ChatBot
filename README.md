# Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/gvolpatolima/ChatBot.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd ChatBot
    Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
    You might need to download nltk-data aswell

# Usage

    Run the chatbot AI: python chat_bot.py
    Type in your message and hit enter
    The chatbot AI will respond with a message

# Dataset

The dataset used to train the chatbot AI can be found in the data directory. This dataset consists of a collection of conversational data, which has been preprocessed and cleaned for use in the chatbot AI.
Model

The chatbot AI uses a neural network model built with Tensorflow and NumPy. The model is trained on the conversational data to learn patterns in user input and generate appropriate responses.
